  abstract = {Accurate structural information about forests, including canopy heights and diameters, is crucial for quantifying tree volume, biomass, and carbon stocks, enabling effective forest ecosystem management, particularly in response to changing environmental conditions. Since late 2018, NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission has monitored global canopy structure using a satellite Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument. While GEDI has collected billions of LiDAR shots across a near-global range (between 51.6°N and {$>$}51.6°S), their spatial distribution remains dispersed, posing challenges for achieving complete forest coverage. This study proposes and evaluates an approach that generates high-resolution canopy height maps by integrating GEDI data with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and topographical ancillary data through three machine learning (ML) algorithms: random forests (RF), gradient tree boost (GB), and classification and regression trees (CART). To achieve this, the secondary aims included the following: (1) to assess the performance of three ML algorithms, RF, GB, and CART, in predicting canopy heights, (2) to evaluate the performance of our canopy height maps using reference canopy height from canopy height models (CHMs), and (3) to compare our canopy height maps with other two existing canopy height maps. RF and GB were the top-performing algorithms, achieving the best 13.32\% and 16\% root mean squared error for broadleaf and coniferous forests, respectively. Validation of the proposed approach revealed that the 100th and 98th percentile, followed by the average of the 75th, 90th, 95th, and 100th percentiles (AVG), were the most accurate GEDI metrics for predicting real canopy heights. Comparisons between predicted and reference CHMs demonstrated accurate predictions for coniferous stands (R-squared = 0.45, RMSE = 29.16\%).},

  abstract = {Deep learning, neural networks and other data-driven processing techniques are increasingly used in the analysis of LiDAR point cloud data in forest environments due to the benefits offered in accuracy and adaptability to new environments. One of the downsides of these techniques in practical applications is the requirement for manually annotated data necessary for training neural networks, which can be time consuming and costly to attain. We develop an approach to training neural networks for forest tree stem segmentation from point clouds that uses synthetic data from a custom tree simulator, which can generate large quantities of training examples without manual human effort. Our tree simulator captures the geometric characteristics of tree stems and foliage, from which automatically-labelled synthetic point clouds can be generated for training a semantic segmentation algorithm based on the PointNet++ architecture. Using evaluations on real aerial and terrestrial LiDAR point clouds from a range of different forest sites, we demonstrate our synthetic data-trained models can out-perform, or provide comparable performance with models trained on real data from other sites or when available real training data is limited (increases in IoU from 1–7\%). Our simulation code is open-source and made available to the research community.},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental questions in ecology is how many species inhabit the Earth. However, due to massive logistical and financial challenges and taxonomic difficulties connected to the species concept definition, the global numbers of species, including those of important and well-studied life forms such as trees, still remain largely unknown. Here, based on global ground-sourced data, we estimate the total tree species richness at global, continental, and biome levels. Our results indicate that there are ∼73,000 tree species globally, among which ∼9,000 tree species are yet to be discovered. Roughly 40\% of undiscovered tree species are in South America. Moreover, almost one-third of all tree species to be discovered may be rare, with very low populations and limited spatial distribution (likely in remote tropical lowlands and mountains). These findings highlight the vulnerability of global forest biodiversity to anthropogenic changes in land use and climate, which disproportionately threaten rare species and thus, global tree richness.},

The differences between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 products, such as the reflectance at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and land surface, should be compared and evaluated to make sure they are spectrally consistent. Their consistency has been evaluated and the differences have been empirically corrected at mid-low latitudes, but in high latitude areas with a higher solar zenith angle (SZA), the similar work has not been explored. In this study, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 TOA and surface reflectance in Alaska as well as some surface parameters, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference snow index (NDSI), were compared using the massive data distributed on Google earth engine (GEE) online platform, and their consistency was evaluated and the uncertainty was analyzed. Some empirical models were suggested to convert Sentinel-2 products to be consistent with Landsat-8 products at all bands. The results show that TOA reflectance is more consistent than surface reflectance in Alaska. This study suggests that the consistency between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 at high latitudes should be paid more attention because their consistency is lower than that at mid-low latitudes.},

  abstract = {Characterization of individual trees is essential for many applications in forest management and ecology. Previous studies relied on single tree detection from monochromatic wavelength airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems and they focused on the use of the geometric spatial information of the point clouds (i.e., X, Y, and Z coordinates). However, there is quite often a difficulty dealing with clumped trees when only the geometric spatial information is considered. The emergence of multispectral LiDAR sensors provides a new solution for individual tree structure acquisition. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of multispectral ALS data for delineating individual trees which are challenging by using the monochromatic wavelength ALS system. The proposed workflow utilizes the mean shift segmentation method on different feature spaces for crown isolation. In addition, both spatial domain and multispectral domain are used to refine the under-segmentation crown segments. Ten plots (2 sets of different structural complexity) located in the dense coniferous forest area in Tobermory, Ontario, Canada are selected as experiment data. Results show that the developed method correctly detects 88\% and 82\% of the dominant trees with and without multispectral information, respectively. Compared with segmentation using geometric spatial information solely, the main improvements are achieved for clumped tree segment with the distinguished multispectral features. This study demonstrates that multispectral airborne laser scanning data is more capable for individual tree delineation than monochromatic wavelength laser scanning data in dealing with forests with clumped crowns in dense forests.},

The new global DEM is a composite of the latest and most accurate freely available DEM sources and will include reprocessed Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data (called NASADEM), high-resolution stereo optical data (ArcticDEM), a new National Elevation Dataset (NED) and various publicly available national datasets including the Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) and DEMs for Sweden, Norway and Finland (SNF). The new DEM will be available world-wide with few exceptions. It is anticipated that the transition from the Collection-1 DEM at 3 arcsecond to the new DEM will be seamless because processing methods to maintain a seamless transition were employed, void filling techniques were used, where persistent gaps were found, and the pixel spacing is the same between the two collections. Improvements to the vertical accuracy were realized by differencing accuracies of other elevation datasets to the new DEM. The greatest improvement occurred where ArcticDEM data were used, where an improvement of 35 m was measured. By using theses improved vertical values in a line of sight algorithm, horizontal improvements were noted in some of the most mountainous regions over multiple 30-m Landsat pixels. This new DEM will be used to process all of the scenes from Landsat 1-8 in Collection-2 processing and will be made available to the public by the end of 2020.},

Geospatially explicit and, ideally, highly resolved information is required to manage terrestrial ecosystems, mitigate climate change and prevent biodiversity loss. Here we present a comprehensive global canopy height map at 10\,m ground sampling distance for the year 2020. We have developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse height data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) space-borne LiDAR mission with dense optical satellite images from Sentinel-2. This model retrieves canopy-top height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth and quantifies the uncertainty in these estimates. Our approach improves the retrieval of tall canopies with typically high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5\% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30\,m. Further, we find that only 34\% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Thus, the approach can serve ongoing efforts in forest conservation and has the potential to foster advances in climate, carbon and biodiversity modelling.},

In this study, four experimental strategies were designed for comparison based on TanDEM-X polarized interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PolInSAR) data, TanDEM-DEM, and 42 field-measured data. Our results show that in the RVoG model, (1) a reference ground phase  to select the volume scattering complex coherence provides greater accuracy in determining forest height, (2) forest height estimation can be achieved by directly using DEM as ground phase information without relying on model solving and obtaining a more accurate forest height than TanDEM-X  alone, and (3) the highest estimation accuracy is obtained by using DEM as coherence information among all schemes. Although the difference in forest height estimation results is not significant in this study, it still proves that the forest height estimation strategy of high-precision DEM  combined with short-wavelength PolInSAR can not only improve the forest height estimation accuracy but also simplify the solving process of the RVoG model, which is an important reference for global forest parameter estimation and ecosystem detection based on spaceborne PolInSAR.},

  abstract = {Biomes are areas of vegetation that are characterized by the same life–form. Traditional definitions of biomes have also included either geographical or climatic descriptors. This approach describes a wide range of biomes that can be correlated with characteristic climatic conditions, or climatic envelopes. The application of remote sensing technology to the frequent observation of biomes has led to a move away from the often subjective definition of biomes to one that is objective. Carefully characterized observations of life–form, by satellite, have been used to reconsider biome classification and their climatic envelopes. Five major tree biomes can be recognized by satellites based on leaf longevity and morphology: needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf evergreen, needleleaf deciduous, broadleaf cold deciduous and broadleaf drought deciduous. Observations indicate that broadleaf drought deciduous vegetation grades substantially into broadleaf evergreen vegetation. The needleleaf deciduous biome occurs in the world's coldest climates, where summer drought and therefore a drought deciduous biome are absent. 				Traditional biome definitions are quite static, implying no change in their life–form composition with time, within their particular climatic envelopes. However, this is not the case where there has been global ingress of grasslands and croplands into forested vegetation. The global spread of grasses, a new super–biome, was probably initiated 30–45 Myr ago by an increase in global aridity, and was driven by the natural spread of the disturbances of fire and animal grazing. These disturbances have been further extended over the Holocene era by human activities that have increased the land areas available for domestic animal grazing and for growing crops. The current situation is that grasses now occur in most, if not all biomes, and in many areas they dominate and define the biome. Croplands are also increasing, defining a new and relatively recent component to the grassland super–biome. In the case of both grassland and croplands, various forms of disturbance, particularly frequent disturbance, lead to continued range extensions of the biomes.},

  abstract = {Individual tree crown delineation is of great importance for forest inventory and management. The increasing availability of high-resolution airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data makes it possible to delineate the crown structure of individual trees and deduce their geometric properties with high accuracy. In this study, we developed an automated segmentation method that is able to fully utilize high-resolution LiDAR data for detecting, extracting, and characterizing individual tree crowns with a multitude of geometric and topological properties. The proposed approach captures topological structure of forest and quantifies topological relationships of tree crowns by using a graph theory-based localized contour tree method, and finally segments individual tree crowns by analogy of recognizing hills from a topographic map. This approach consists of five key technical components: (1) derivation of canopy height model from airborne LiDAR data; (2) generation of contours based on the canopy height model; (3) extraction of hierarchical structures of tree crowns using the localized contour tree method; (4) delineation of individual tree crowns by segmenting hierarchical crown structure; and (5) calculation of geometric and topological properties of individual trees. We applied our new method to the Medicine Bow National Forest in the southwest of Laramie, Wyoming and the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest in the central portion of the Cascade Range of Oregon, U.S. The results reveal that the overall accuracy of individual tree crown delineation for the two study areas achieved 94.21\% and 75.07\%, respectively. Our method holds great potential for segmenting individual tree crowns under various forest conditions. Furthermore, the geometric and topological attributes derived from our method provide comprehensive and essential information for forest management.},
